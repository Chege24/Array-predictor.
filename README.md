COUNTDOWN PREDICTION.
This is a Python code that implements a countdown prediction application using various prediction methods. 
The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. It allows the user to enter 
a countdown value and predicts the outcome using different techniques. The predicted outcome and accuracy are 
displayed on the GUI.

DEPENDENCIES.
The code requires the following dependencies:
tkinter: A standard Python library for creating GUI applications.
messagebox module from the tkinter library: Used for displaying error and success messages.
math: A standard Python library providing mathematical functions.
numpy: A library for mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python, used for linear regression.
pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
sqlite3: A Python module for working with SQLite databases.
torch: A machine learning library, used for creating and training neural networks.
transformers: A library for natural language processing (NLP) using pre-trained models.

SETUP.
The code assumes the existence of a SQLite database file named countdown_records.db. If the file doesn't exist, it 
will be created automatically.
The code also assumes the existence of a table named countdown in the database. If the table doesn't exist, it 
will be created automatically with the following columns:
id: INTEGER (primary key, auto-increment)
countdown: REAL
prediction: REAL
accuracy: FLOAT
Functions


The code includes the following functions:

predict_outcome_sklearn(countdown): Predicts the outcome using scikit-learn's linear regression model.
predict_outcome_math(countdown): Predicts the outcome using a mathematical function.
predict_outcome_numpy(countdown): Predicts the outcome using numpy.
predict_outcome_pytorch(countdown): Predicts the outcome using a PyTorch neural network.
predict_outcome_transformers(countdown): Predicts the outcome using the Transformers library and a pre-trained model.
update_accuracy(countdown, prediction): Updates the accuracy for a given prediction method.
update_prediction_label(c): Updates the prediction and accuracy labels on the GUI.
clear_entry_box(): Clears the countdown entry box on the GUI.
save_countdown(): Saves the countdown value and predictions to the database.
handle_enter(event): Handles the Enter key press event and calls the save_countdown() function.
mainloop(): Starts the main loop of the GUI application.


USAGE.
Make sure all the dependencies are installed in python.
Set up the SQLite database file (countdown_records.db) and the countdown table.
Run the Python code.
The GUI application window will open, where you can enter a countdown value. Press Enter or click the "Save" button to save 
the countdown value and display the predicted outcome and accuracy. The prediction and accuracy labels will be updated accordingly.

You can try different prediction methods, including scikit-learn, math, numpy, PyTorch, and Transformers. The application will compare 
the accuracy of each method and display the best prediction along with its accuracy.

Note.
The code assumes that the database file (countdown_records.db) and the required table (countdown) are set up correctly.
You may need to modify the code to fit your specific requirements, such as changing the database file name or modifying the prediction methods.
This code is provided as a starting point for building a countdown prediction application and may require additional modifications and 
improvements depending on the nature of the data being used.
